### Aim
The aim of this `classification` notebook is to investigate classification problems and how to approach them using supervised machine learning techniques.

I used here the example of a political dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records). It consists of votes made by US House of Representatives Congressmen. The goal is to predict their party affiliation ('Democrat' or 'Republican') based on how they voted on certain key issues.


### Description of the notebooks

* [congress_votes-part1.ipynb](https://github.com/lhoupert/ds_portfolio/blob/master/notebooks/classification/congress_votes-part1.ipynb): Deploy a K-Nearest Neighbors model
* [congress_votes-part2.ipynb](https://github.com/lhoupert/ds_portfolio/blob/master/notebooks/classification/congress_votes-part2.ipynb): Deploy a Logistic Regression model

### Notes

*It is a work in progress... I am trying to work on it whenever I have some 'free' time*
