### Aim
The aim of this `clustering` notebook is to investigate if  machine learning can be used to detect coherent spatial pattern in oceanography data.


In physical oceanography,  a water mass is defined as body of ocean water with a distinctive narrow range of temperature and salinity.

-> If the data are coherent in space, we could use these results to create an automatic method which would identify if  a new measurement belong to the his “geographic cluster”, or if it is an outlier.

### Notes

*It is a work in progress... I am trying to work on it whenever I have some 'free' time*
